## Installation

To use this application you can download this github repository either by cloning or downloading the zip file

## Usage

This project focuses mainly on backend production so you will need a server to run this program 

When this application is first opened, this is the homepage that you would be greeted with:

![homepage](/README-pictures/home-page.png)

You would then want to click on the "Get Started" button to go to the next page, which will display the following:

![notes page](/README-pictures/notes-page.png)

Once a note is completed, it can eb saved by clicking on the save button on the top right hand side, or click on the plus button to start a new note:

After a note is saved, it will appear on the column to the left side of the page. Which can then be deleted by clicking on the trash can icon:

Finally once the note is deleted, it will dissapear from the column of the left side of the screen:
